# Vaccination-Database
DBMS project
<h3>The project aims at designing the database management system for vaccination in India. The database contains all the important information regarding vaccines, vaccination center, suppliers, health worker and hospitals. This information would be readily available to the health organizations and government bodies which would play vital role in the success of vaccination camps across the nation.</h3>
